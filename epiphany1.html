					<div><h1>Wake Up! - <span class="date">January 6th, 2012</span></h1></div>
					<div class="post">
						<p>
						One of the influences behind this segment was a book called &#34;The 3 A.M. Epiphany&#34; by Brian Kiteley. The book is full of awesomely useful writing exercises that help creative writers get outside of their comfort zone and experiment to stretch the limits of their writing, particularly fiction. The &#34;Dan&#39;s Epiphanies&#34; segment won&#39;t just draw directly from Kiteley&#39;s ideas every week, but his exercises get to the heart of why I value writing and value sharing it with an audience: Not only to relate to others on a creative level, but also to allow others to integrate that creativity into their own work and share it in their own way, allowing everyone to develop and flex their creative muscles. Enjoy!						</p>
						<p>
						From p. 21, Exercise 2: &#34;<b>Imperative</b>. Write a fragment of a story that is made up entirely of imperative commands: Do this; do that; contemplate the rear end of the woman who is walking out of your life. This exercise will be a sort of second-person narration (a you is implied in the imperative). 500 Words&#34;						</p>
						<h3>Wake Up</h3>
						<p>
						Listen idly to the persistent beeping of your phone alarm. Do not hit the snooze button yet, let the phone buzz angrily until your apathy breaks its determination and renders it silent again. Look to make sure that there are at least 5 more alarms set, separated by 15 minute intervals, so that returning to a complete sleep will be impossible from now on. Drop the phone to the floor and stare at the ceiling, awaiting the next inevitable volley of beeps and buzzes. Do not think about what happened last night, or the night before that, or any of the nights where you drank until you couldn&#39;t stand up, and by the time you had control of your brain again you couldn&#39;t remember why you had done any of it in the first place. Look at the ceiling. Look through the gaps in the blinds and listen for passing cars and the loud banging of the cranes and jackhammers across the street. Don&#39;t do anything else, just observe listlessly the world around you, here, in this moment. Take it all in, isolate this moment and all of these images in your mind, until the beeping of a truck in reverse melds with another assault on your ears courtesy of the phone buzzing away on the floor. Pull yourself slowly out of bed, grab the phone and jab at buttons blindly and randomly until the noise dies down. Don&#39;t forget to grab your glasses, and pray that they aren&#39;t broken as you pull them out of the tangle of bedsheets where they got stuck after you passed out on top of them, just like every night. Stare through the blurry lenses and just stand in the middle of the room for a minute. Make sure that you haven&#39;t woken up in some stranger&#39;s house, check for the haphazard piles of clothes that decorate the floor, remember how she always complained about the mess and the smell. Focus on that image for a moment, then shake it off and meander over to the bathroom. Observe the inevitable disarray of the living room as you pass it, strain your eyes to make sure that the door is locked, it probably won&#39;t be. Check to see at least that the TV hasn&#39;t been stolen. Open the bathroom window to get some air flowing, lean against the sink and stare into the mirror. Look at the giant, dark bags under your eyes, your glasses skewed to one side, and your hair in complete disarray. Remember how she would address you in the morning if you came out of the bedroom looking as disheveled as you look right now, yelling at you for being such a lazy and stupid drunk. Remember her coffee mug and the crash it made as it shattered on the wall behind you, and her crazed, tear-covered face and she stared at your glazed-over expression, and remember her slamming the door when that face in the mirror did nothing to deny her accusations. Jump at the third rendition of that grating symphony of beeps and buzzes, and meticulously turn off all the remaining alarms. Pull back the curtain and start the shower, and listen to the loud, blasting flow of the water as it heats up at an agonizing pace. Remember that the fridge is probably empty again, and that refilling it could be either the best or the worst idea you&#39;ve had all day.						</p>
						<p>------------------</p>

						When Kiteley said &#34;contemplate the rear end of the woman who is walking out of your life&#34;, I took that less as an example of a single imperative statement that could be a part of the piece, and more as a framework to craft the entire piece around. Amidst the haze of waking up and observing the room, the piece is littered with memories that indicate that the woman leaving is the center of the piece&#39;s attention. Another interesting technique would be to take any instances of the narrator telling the reader to &#34;remember her&#34; or anything to do with the woman, and replace those sections with &#34;don&#39;t remember her&#34;, or &#34;don&#39;t think about how she&#34;, etc. How would this change the feel of the piece, if at all? Would it make it sound more or less genuine? Would it change how we feel about the narrator if he was actively trying to forget this woman by focusing on concretely observing his apartment as opposed to using those observations to remember her? Kitely notes &#34;one of the unintended consequences of this exercise, which I&#39;ve seen in my workshops, is that students discover countless different and imaginative ways of regulating time in their stories when these barking or plaintive commands take over the narrative. The effect of a command is to move time forward on the say-so of the commanding voice.&#34; (21) The main reason I turn to Kiteley&#39;s book so often for writing ideas is because his exercises are perfect for dragging writers out of their comfort zone and forcing them to try drastically new styles in an extreme manner, so they get a sort of crash course in the many ways that the technique can function in a vacuum, that way they can tone it down and integrate it seamlessly in a more complete and complex work.						</p>
