					<div><h1>The Heimal Synod - <span class="date">January 1st, 2012</span></h1></div>
					<div class="post">
						From <a href="http://www.wiktionary.com">Wiktionary</a>:<br />
						synod <i>noun</i> (plural synods)<br />
						1. An ecclesiastic council or meeting to consult on church matters.<br />
						2. An administrative division of churches, either the entire denomination, 
						as in the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, or a mid-level division 
						(middle judicatory, district) as in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America<br />
						<br />
						From <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a>:<br />
						hiemal <i>adjective</i><br />
						1.	Of or pertaining to winter; wintry.<br />
						<br />
						There hadn&#39;t been a single flake, and it was already the 25th. <br />
						It had barely even rained, really, it just looked dreary most of the time. <br />
						Of course it was cold, but it was always cold, it was the pacific northwest. <br />
						The frigid branches outside the window swayed slowly in the light breeze, <br />
						While the pine-covered branches on the three inside glowed with colored lights, <br />
						Some bending drastically under the weight of pictures of children glued onto snowflakes, <br />
						Others carrying the intricate blown-glass-looking baubles and twisting, purple and blue icicles. <br />
						The angel sat quietly atop the inside tree much like the rare bald eagle perched atop the one outside. <br />
						The house was abnormally quiet compared to the last two days, <br />
						No kids yelling excitedly, no wrapping paper being scrunched underfoot, <br />
						No Charlie Brown Christmas Carols lilting smoothly out of the old boombox-style CD player. <br />
						Just the washer and dryer doing their noisy yet muffled, mechanical yet strangely rhythmic work. <br />
						Stockings lying on the fireplace, stuffed to the brim, and giant, still-wrapped boxes under the tree. <br />
						Everyone else was at church. They were missing out. <br />


						<h3>Breakdown:</h3>
						<p>This piece pretty much speaks for itself, I feel like, in that it&#39;s 
						largely just me observing my grandparent&#39;s house during Christmas morning, 
						but it gets to the heart of something I truly believe in about writing, and that 
						makes it especially important to me. Simply by observing the things around you, 
						singling things out, linking them together, and really just losing yourself in 
						the ambience of your surroundings, you&#39;ll be able to pour out a ton of creative 
						content, and usually quite quickly. It makes for a good poetic foundation, as 
						images are an enormous part of poetry in my experience, or it can just set the 
						stage for a scene in a piece of fiction. Images are arguably the most important 
						part of writing, so it&#39;s important to constantly be aware of them and really 
						bear down on them and understand how to effectively and creatively convey them 
						with words. Even if it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s that much interesting 
						stuff around you, if you really go to work observing the specific nuances of 
						any area, and start connecting them to other things, even other images, you&#39;ll 
						be well on your way to becoming a better writer.</p>
